    "- Both coefficients are positive, indicating a tendency for higher exercise hours to be associated with lower BMI.\n",

Pearson's correlation coefficient is more sensitive to outliers and assumes a linear relationship, while Spearman's rank correlation is based on the ranks and is more robust to outliers and non-linear relationships."
